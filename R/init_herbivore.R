#' Initialise a herbivore agent
#'
#' Constructs a herbivore list with spatial state, gut compartments, and
#' daily trackers. Derived foraging traits are computed from mass.
#'
#' @param mass Herbivore mass (g).
#' @param herb_type Integer behaviour type (0=grazer, 1=browser, 2=mixed).
#' @param MRT Mean retention time (hours) for gut compartments.
#' @return Herbivore state list ready for simulation.
