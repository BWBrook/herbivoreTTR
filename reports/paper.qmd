# Introduction

This Quarto document is a placeholder for your analysis report.  You can
embed text, code chunks, and figures.  The pipeline defined in
`_targets.R` should generate all necessary intermediate data; in this
document you can read those data via the targets API or by loading
files under `data/processed/`.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
library(dplyr)
# Add code here to summarise your results
```
