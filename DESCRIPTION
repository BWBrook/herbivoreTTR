Description: A quantitative plantâ€“herbivore simulation model ported from C++.
    Implements a Thornley Transport Resistance (TTR) model for plant growth
    coupled with individual-based herbivore foraging behaviour.  This package
    aims to facilitate testing, calibration, and extension within the R ecosystem.
